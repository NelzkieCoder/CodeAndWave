## My first project that I actually release
Though I have been programming for quite a while now and got a lot of projects in my hard drive, this is actually my first project in android to be release(since mostly I focus on game programming) and boy what a great feeling. I will add more features in the coming months. This project is an on going process. I will keep adding features until I am satisfied.

<!--break-->

The app is simple but during the whole journey, I learned a lot just by developing this apps.  I put those lessons learned on my list and read it when I am about to do my next app.

### Complete UI redesign.
The first design I had on the app sucks and lags so bad. So created the app from the scratch  using the full power of MVP. I must say, it serve me quite well.
