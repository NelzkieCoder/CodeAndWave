### **What is the purpose of this blog?**

The purpose of this humble nice looking(*too much?*) blog is to act as my journal on my programming journey from beginner to let's say not beginner. In here I will talk about stuff I have learned and the projects I've done and is currently working on. If anyone find my blog useful then I'm glad I help you. Happy coding!
